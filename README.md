## About
PathMaster implements the A-star algorithm, which uses a guess of how many
squares away the goal nodes are to optimize Dijkstra's Algorithm, which
finds the lowest distance path to any point in a graph.

Clicking on any square in the grid will change what type of tile it is.
X's are impassable, G's are the goal squares, and S's the start squares.
You really should only have one Goal and Start square.
